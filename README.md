- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnPluznyk, Currently I am a senior computer science student at West Chester University.
- ðŸ‘€ My main interests are in software egineering and cyber secuirty.  Right now I in my free time I am looking into different ways of reverse engineering.  Such as using a hex editor.
- My favorite game growing up was pokemon and I got this tool called an action replay.  Essentially it booted up the game and let you mod the game in machine language.  At the time I didn't know I was coding but that was my introduction to coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about computer security and ethics.  I am also taking a class called programming languages concepts/Paradigm.  Recently,
in this class we have been discecting the compiler and how it works for multiple languages.
