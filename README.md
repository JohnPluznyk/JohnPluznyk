- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnPluznyk, Currently I am a senior computer science student at West Chester University.
- ðŸ‘€ My main interests are in software egineering and cyber secuirty.  Currently in my free time I explore all kinds of topics.  I recently have been focusing on topics relating to gnu/linuix due to the fact that software is mostly open source.  GNU/Linux is a fun learning curve in my opinon and can teach one a lot of about software, security, or operating systems.
- My introduction to coding was in grade school.  My favorite game growing up was pokemon and I got this tool called an action replay.  Essentially it booted up the game and let you mod the games binary.  At the time I didn't know I was coding but that was my introduction to coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about operating systems, databases, compilers, and computer security.  My favorite class is by far the operating systems.  I think it is very interesting as to how an O.S. and the modern day techniques that are used on today's operating sytstems.
