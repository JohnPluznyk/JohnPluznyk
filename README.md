- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnPluznyk, Currently I am a senior computer science student at West Chester University.
- 👀 My main interests are in software egineering and cyber secuirty.  Currently in my free time I explore all kinds of topics.  I recently have been focusing on topics relating to gnu/linuix due to the fact that software is mostly open source.  GNU/Linux is a fun learning curve in my opinon and can teach one a lot of about software, security, or operating systems.
- My introduction to coding was in grade school.  My favorite game growing up was pokemon and I got this tool called an action replay.  Essentially it booted up the game and let you mod the games binary.  At the time I didn't know I was coding but that was my introduction to coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cloud computing, and computer security/malware analysis.  My favorite class is by far is malware analysis.

- Linux 🐧 vs. Free BSD 😡 - Let me know what you think is better.
