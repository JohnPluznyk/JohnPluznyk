# Hi, I’m @JohnPluznyk, 😄
- I am a graduate of West Chester University, PA with a bachelors in Computer Science.  My main interests are in software egineering, networking, and cyber secuirty.  Currently in my free time I explore all kinds of topics.  I recently have been focusing on topics relating to gnu/linuix due to the fact that software is mostly open source.  GNU/Linux is a fun learning curve in my opinon and can teach one a lot of about software, security, or operating systems.
- My introduction to coding was in grade school.  My favorite game growing up was pokemon and I got this tool called an action replay.  Essentially it booted up the game and let you mod the games binary.  At the time I didn't know I was coding but that was my introduction to coding.
- I’m currently learning c++ so I can explore the core systems of Linux and how exactly they function. I am using the website Learncpp.com to learn c++.
